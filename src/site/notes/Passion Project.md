# Welcome to Passion Project.

>   A **passion project** is a personal project that someone undertakes out of a strong interest or curiosity in a particular topic, idea, or skill.  It is usually a self-directed project that is not tied to any specific academic or professional requirement.  **Passion projects** can take many forms, including creative endeavors, community initiatives, research projects, or personal challenges.
